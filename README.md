Created a visually stunning website that showcases Viet's previous achievement of being awarded Top Design 2021.
The project demonstrates the ability to integrate design skills with web development to create an elegant and
sophisticated website that serves as an art gallery. The website provides a clean and intuitive user interface
that highlights the art design while maintaining smooth navigation and interactive features.
