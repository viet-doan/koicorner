    <h1> About Us </h1>
    <p> 
    Koi Corner is a renowned bubble milk tea chain that was born and
    brewed in Japan in 2003. Ever since 2010, their brand was adjusted to
    target international customers, and was esstablished as a well-recognised
    worldwide brand with stores located over 25 countries with luxurious and 
    delightful sweet beverages. The figure of a Koi fish is closely tied with
    Japan's national identity and is the symbol for Koi Corner, instituting its
    origin and brand identity.

    The luxurious aesthetic of the Japanese bubble-milk tea franchise Koi
    Corner influenced the design of the logo and re-usable drink cjontainer. The
    elegant symbol of the Koi fish and vertically aligned type, highlights the
    brand's origin and along with the sophisticated form of the bottle,creates
    an authentic visual language that promotes the store.
